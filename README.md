# SIXT Sales Cloud

SIXT Denmark is looking to implement a fleet system to track the lifecycle of all its vehicle passing through the company supply chain. The scope of the system is to track a vehicle through the part of its value chain which Sixt handels. That is the downstream part; from the forecast phase through car order where SIXT works with various partners such as importers, dealers and leasing / financing companies.  Then throughout the cars lifecycle within SIXT while having the possibility to cover short- and long-term rentals as well as damage checks and fines, all through the sales funnel of the vehicles to buybackers and dealers within and outside Denmark.
